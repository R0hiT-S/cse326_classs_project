          <h2>Fundamentals of C++</h2>
          <p>
            This book teaches the basics of C++ programming in an easy-to-follow
            style, without assuming previous experience in any other language. A
            variety of examples such as game programming, club membership
            organization, grade tracking and grade point average calculation,
            make learning C++ both fun and practical. Each chapter contains at
            least one complete, fully functional example program, with several
            smaller examples provided throughout the book.

          <h2>PYTHON FOR EVERYBODY: EXPLORING DATA IN PYTHON 3</h2>
          <p>
            Python for Everybody is designed to introduce students to
            programming and software development through the lens of exploring
            data.You can think of the Python programming language as your tool
            to solve data problems that are beyond the capability of a
            spreadsheet.
            <br />
            The goal of this book is to provide an Informatics-oriented
            introduction to programming. The primary difference between a
            computer science approach and the Informatics approach taken in this
            book is a greater focus on using Python to solve data analysis
            problems common in the world of Informatics. The sample code and
            data files for the book is here: Code Samples.

          <p>
            Essential CSS is written to provide clear and concise explanation of
            topics for both beginner and advanced programmers.

            Most examples are linked to online playground that allows you to
            change the code and re-run it. <br />
            The content is based on now abandoned StackOverflow Documentation
            project. It has been heavily edited and improved.

          <p>
            Eloquent JavaScript is written by someone who really knows their
            stuff and can communicate it well to beginners. The book also
            includes exercises and examples to help you learn. Those samples
            make this an excellent book to refer back to over time to refresh or
            as a general reference.
